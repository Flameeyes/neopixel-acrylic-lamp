# Neopixel Acrylic Lamp

This repository contains Eagle PCB dsigns and 3D objects to build a lamp hosting an acrylic
cutout, similar to the many "3D effect" lamps that you can buy on most online stores by now.

Please note that while rev3 boards appear to be working, the 3D objects are still untested
and the design is still up in the air.
